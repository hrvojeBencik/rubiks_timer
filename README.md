# rubiks_timer

As a big fan or Rubik's cube and owner of many of them I got an idea to create timer that will help me increase my speed of solving the cube.

Other than timer application alse provides algorithm for scrambling the cube. When you slide bottom sheet upwards it will show you the algortihm.
